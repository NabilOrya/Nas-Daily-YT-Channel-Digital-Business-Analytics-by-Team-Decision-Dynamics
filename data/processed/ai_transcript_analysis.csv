l5PTG1m9vEE,"Meet Angie. Hi, my name is Angie and I used to be a man. Two years ago, Angie's dad passed away, making him realize that life is short and that you need to follow what makes you happy. So he decided to do what he felt for years, change his gender to become a woman. And he decided to come out publicly using Instagram. His original username was HailToTheKing. And her new account? HailToTheQueen. And that is how everyone knew that Ian is now Angie. This was no easy thing to do, and Angie expected a lot of pushback, but to her surprise, 99% of the reception was love and support. When Angie was Ian, she was married to the supermodel Joey for 10 years. Now, she is still married to the same woman, and she still designs, builds, and races in the most manly world ever, the car world. Because sometimes, the king can also be a queen. That's one minute, see you tomorrow. Thank you.",POSITIVE,0.985509991645813,0.989820122718811,0.9998414516448975

qsMiiLHVDe8,hey let me ask you a question what what time do you normally wake up 10 a.m. see like many of you I used to wake up at 10 and sometimes 11 a.m. and by the time I finished breakfast the day is almost over but over the past week I've been working with the International Red Cross in Kahaluu Guinea they do to security and lack of electricity in these areas we can only work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. which means we have to wake up early and sleep early and this very strict schedule has surprisingly made every day much more productive and everyone's energy is through the roof nothing wrong with staying up late and waking up late if it suits you but for us every day became a lot more productive we're going woke up with the Sun and went to sleep with the Sun that's one minute see you tomorrow,POSITIVE,0.7698748111724854,0.5866738557815552,0.6523440480232239
mn2UAPYD5PM,everyone knows that children learn very quickly and whatever they learn they keep for the rest of their life that's why here in the country of Armenia I was amazed to see that in addition to math and science children also learn chess here every child is taught chess with dedicated schools and classrooms this teaches them how to focus compete and develop their cognitive skills so they grow up to become grandmasters like this guy with highly-developed brains all from a game of chess armenia is one of the best countries at chess in the world just ask their president yes I'm the president and we love chess Plus this isn't just about chess it's about what we teach children if we teach them discipline patience strategy and focus from a young age we can create a world where everyone is a grandmaster,POSITIVE,0.9996744394302368,0.8437422513961792,0.9984087347984314
ZuLC4j_ohdw,"Hi. When I was 14 years old, my dad would compare me to the Japanese kids. He would say, kids in Japan are so smart, by the time they're 14 years, they have invented an app. And that would make me jealous. But 10 years later, I went to visit Japan only to see what my dad didn't see. I saw the smartest people in the world, but I also saw depression, stress, and suicide rates that are so high, there's an actual forest called the suicide forest in Japan. Turns out there's a hidden cost to all the expectations we have from people. The more expectations, the more pressure, the more unhappy life gets. Like my dad, I want my kids to be as smart as the Japanese, but I want them to do it only when the time is right. That's one minute.

xvyMZ_4Zmj8,"Hi. When you think of energy, you normally think of coal, you think of wind, you think of solar. But what you don't think of is the poop of guinea pigs. Yes, I have just arrived to a farm in the country of Peru, where these farmers created energy from the poop of guinea pigs. This process is simple. They take the poop of 1,000 guinea pigs, put it in underground chambers and pressure it. And that creates methane gas that can power their farm, appliances and light bulbs. And the poop leftovers? They put in Coca-Cola bottles, called it... Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola. And use it as a fertilizer to turn their entire farm green. We make this product from the guinea pig poop. This unique method is not enough to replace electricity. But it shows that you can make something out of nothing. That you can power a farm from guinea pig poop. Esto fue Minuto. Y nos vemos mañana.

When I drank, when I dated, when I traveled, I was told not to. If it isn't obvious by now, I'm not a religious Muslim, but I'm also not a bad one. I don't force my beliefs on people. I don't oppress freedoms or ideas. A good Muslim, Christian, or Jew, or atheist is someone that keeps religion to themselves and appreciates the world for what it is.

You give her your friend's picture and name and bam! She beats the heck out of him. Again and again and again and again. So that in real life, He feels the pain. Then she feeds him to a tiger, curses him with words, and sets him on fire. This is called petty person beating. And in Hong Kong, it's a real way people take vengeance on others.

Zvtekg8GW4s,"Hi. When I first came to Australia, like the majority of tourists, I landed in Sydney and then Melbourne. There, I met hundreds and hundreds of Australians. And out of everybody that I met, zero of them were aboriginals. That's why I flew all the way to the northwestern tip of Australia in Broome and drove through the middle of nowhere to meet a small community in the outback where these guys live. The Aboriginals. They are the first people to step foot in Australia thousands of years ago. They have their own languages, arts, swag, music and pride. Now, these guys are only 3% of Australia but their influence here goes back thousands and thousands of years. The next time you think of Australia, think of Aboriginals because they deserve recognition and certainly deserve a visit. That's one minute. See you tomorrow. Before you go, one last thing. That video you just saw, I made using this camera and this microphone. But for the first time ever, I'm ditching my camera and I'm picking up my podcasting equipment. Because yes... I'm starting a podcast. It's called Mass Talks. It's free and it's only on Spotify. And if you liked that video, I think you're gonna love the podcast because I just wanted to make a podcast about things that I would listen to, about topics that I wanna listen to. Yes. Nasdaq is 100% honest and raw and deep. And by the way, it's 100% free. So keep your money and give me your ears. Because if you like this video, I think you're going to love this podcast.

Which, to our surprise, was not as expensive as the rest of Europe. $3 for a kebab, $5 for a pizza, $2 for beer. Berlin is cheaper than New York, Paris, Los Angeles, and even back home. But why? Here's my best guess. Berlin was divided. And right as this Berlin Wall fell, the city was rebuilt for everybody. Rent prices are controlled by the government so they don't grow fast. Public transportation is designed to be affordable. And here, minimum wages are designed to be livable wages, not just minimum.

mnxv2DmXFUY, the united states is the best country in the world in terms of economy opportunity military and technology it's the country i love the most and the one i want to live and die in and it's the country everybody looks at for leadership but in our fascination with the american dream we forget that the us has gotten a lot of things wrong and countries like even developing ones have managed to get some of them right that's why i went on a mission around the world to zimbabwe zimbabwe rwanda japan and south africa to show the things they got right while the u.s still gets wrong and the journey starts in the underdeveloped country of zimbabwe i ran out of cash i went to all these banks to get cash and there is none left the atms are not even working here in zimbabwe the government screwed up the economy but the people found a way around it your phone this is my new wallet with ecash and it works better than my old one you can pay for parking with your phone street vendors with your phone highway vendors with your phone do you take echo cash yes i can and even the homeless i helped with my phone that's incredible goody thank you back to bank transfers here happen in a second cash is no longer king in new york or even japan cash is still king and bank transfers take days in this underdeveloped country with a collapsed economy and a dysfunctional government there are still lessons to be learned by the developed nations this wallet is amazing that's one minute see you tomorrow the u.s spends a lot of money on security and it should but it can still be a dangerous place sometimes gangs crime and mass shootings building a secure and safe community is a tough task but to see a safe secure country in real life for that you have to go outside of the united states to japan hi i'm ness no you're not paul hi i'm nas today's video is not about how beautiful tokyo is  it's actually about how safe this goddamn place is okay it's so safe in tokyo that if you put your 1200 drone bag in the middle of the street no one will touch it in other countries people think this bag will either get them super rich or bombed to death by someone that looks like me i'm sorry it's just the way it is it's so safe in tokyo that you can just leave your bike unattended leave your phone unattended and even put your money unattended in the middle of the street and no one will give a Â __Â  maybe that was a little bit of an exaggeration will i ever get robbed here probably but crime is one less thing to think about here in tokyo that's one minute see you tomorrow next up women they're oftentimes underrepresented in countries around the world in the u.s the senate is 20 women while women are half the population in the african country of rwanda that percentage is 64 the highest in the world today's video is not about the sad history of rwanda it's actually about how rwandans bounce back from tragedy only 23 years ago over 1 million people died and 300 000 women were raped when the hutu attacked the tutsi and now there is no more hutu or tutsi there is just rwandan women are on the rise in terms of women equality rwanda is doing better than the us there's even a woman minister of gender that's her in african rwanda technology is also on the rise t-con makes software for police 2. mitchumnesa is catching water fees using sensor technology pikiwash cleans your motorbike automatically and this woman is a manager the country of rwanda should be known not for what it was 23 years ago but for what it will be 23 years from now that's one minute see you tomorrow the last story is not about a country it's about a person it's about someone that lives outside of the united states in south africa but is someone that i think his story you would appreciate meet and po hi my name is simpo i made this robot from fresh as i was walking down the street in soweto south africa's largest township i saw operating a robot that he built himself he would touch one of seven levers and the robot would go up and down it would even lift things and move them the robot is made of discarded materials like the battery of an elevator and the motor of a drill machine and this took me two weeks to build this is a genius product built by a 20 year old kid with very little support i'm the only i'm the only one who is working out of familiar form if the same talent was found in another 20 year old kid in the us they would probably be at google but for now you can find him poe at the side of a street waiting to be recognized that's one minute exactly all these talents solutions and systems around the world can oftentimes be overlooked simply because they are not in the united states a cash-free app in san francisco would be valued at billions of dollars with no revenue i know because i used to work for one in zimbabwe a similar app gets barely any news and makes more revenue the united states is truly amazing and the american dream is real i'm living it but in the future more and more developing countries will be developed and we should pay attention to them they say the united states is the best country in the world in reality every country is the best

eFnYoa6XMwQ,"Good morning! Right now, I'm in one of the most romantic countries in the world, the Maldives. This is where a lot of people come for their honeymoon to celebrate their marriage. But little do they know that this is the place with the highest divorce rate in the world. In this conservative nation, people divorce and marry each other more than anywhere else. There are many reasons why, but here it seems like it's not a big deal if you're divorced. There is no stigma around it. And bad marriages end with little consequences. In other countries, divorce is a big deal, taboo or even illegal, and it hurts women more than men. The Maldives has many issues and they definitely do not have it all figured out. But at least here, if you're a man or a woman and your marriage isn't working, you don't have to spend your life trying to make it work. That's one minute. See you tomorrow.

FGj6RlZAnyA,"Meet Liraz. Hi, my name is Liraz. And this hair is not mine. When she was 17, Liraz found out she had cancer. And after six months of chemotherapy, she lost her hair. And as a result, lost her self-confidence. It was hard. But this is where it gets interesting. A hundred thousand other women like these women came to help with their hair. They went to the salon and donated two years worth of hair just so cancer patients like Liraz could get their old look back. They take the hair, put it together, and voila! Confidence is back. This is a clear example of community members helping others at a time of need without payment, money, or credit. Even the salons are not charging for this. It's free. Liraz is now cancer-free and is growing her old hair back. But she can't wait to donate it to other women that need it. That's why I mean it. See you tomorrow!
